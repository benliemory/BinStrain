Description: Uses a binomial model to describe the observed alternative allele (SNP) in a  target genomic region (or the whole genome). A well-established two step method is used to estimate the proportion of serovar strain-specific SNPs present in pure or mixed infection of genotypes. First step is a direct estimate by using the sparsity of the design matrix. Quadratic optimization method is involved in the second step.  Originally developed for direct sequencing of C. trachomatis from clinical samples.
